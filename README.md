## Description  
This repository contains projects from Harvard's CS50AI course. Within each topic there are one or two projects, and each project consists of a script with tasks and a script in which the tasks are completed.

Within the Tic Tac Toe project, there are three scripts that were developed independently of this project and are used to compare AI approaches to solving problems according to a predetermined pattern.
